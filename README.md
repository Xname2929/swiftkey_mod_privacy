you need a password to open and extract the folders (<code>three minus two = ?</code>),  
you also need <a href="https://github.com/mcmilk/7-Zip-zstd/releases/latest">https://github.com/mcmilk/7-Zip-zstd/releases/latest</a>.  
Beyond Compare an alternative program to compare the content of the folders so you'll understand the differences: <a href="https://alternativeto.net/software/beyond-compare/">https://alternativeto.net/software/beyond-compare/</a>.  

And APKTool (JAR) and JAVA if you with to build it yourself,  
you can get them from <a href="https://github.com/eladkarako/icompile/releases/latest">https://github.com/eladkarako/icompile/releases/latest</a> (look for apktool jar.zip),  
and for JAVA (JDK) download and extract the content x64 1.8 from <a href="https://github.com/eladkarako/JDK-archive">https://github.com/eladkarako/JDK-archive</a> (just extract it to something like <code>c:\Software\Java\8\x64\jdk1.8.0_151</code> and follow the rest of the instructions on that page).

Then you have to (re)build the API, sign it (java providing tools to generate keystore) and align it (also provided by Java).
